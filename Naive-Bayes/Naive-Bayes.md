## Project Title
Naive Bayes Classifier with Iris Dataset
## Project Overview
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the species of flowers from the Iris dataset. The Naive Bayes algorithm is based on Bayes' Theorem and is well-suited for classification tasks involving categorical or continuous input features.

The Iris dataset is a famous dataset for machine learning, containing 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica), with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
